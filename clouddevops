Cloud DevOps combines the principles of DevOps with cloud computing to enhance software development and IT operations. It focuses on automating and integrating the processes between software development and IT teams, enabling continuous delivery and infrastructure management using cloud services. Key practices in Cloud DevOps include continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD), infrastructure as code (IaC), and automated testing and monitoring. By leveraging cloud platforms, organizations can scale their applications dynamically, improve collaboration, and accelerate the deployment of new features. This approach enhances efficiency, reduces time to market, and ensures the reliability and stability of applications through automated and consistent processes.
